Have a good day to every one and Assalamualaikum!  The project i uploaded on the github is my first ever major project in the field of c++. Basically I am  astudent at fast national university islamabad.
This project was our first semester project its not completed because of some time constraints yet but in near future I will be working on it.
I invite you all to contribute in my project to enhance its yield.
Lastly I want to tell something about the project, so it is a bee shooting game developed using sfml library.
I made 4 level including one boss level which is yet  uncomplete.This is all about the game now you should explore it.
Thanks
